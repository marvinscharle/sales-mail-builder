# SalesMailBuilder

## What it does

Simple app that allows you to set pre-defined text blocks that can quickly be combined to form e.g. a business mail. 

All data is saved in local storage, no internet connection is required.

**Tip:** You can use placeholders `{{salutation}}` and `{{lastName}}` to quickly insert those values. 

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
